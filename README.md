# odin-recipes

Baking with Bex is a simple  blog style recipe website I made to practice my basics in an actionable and easily tested way.

My objective with this project was to take everything I had learned thus far and put it to use. These skills included HTML fundamentals, working with git and gitHub, formatting files in VS Code, and exclusively relying on the command line interface for creating, moving and navigating any new files. 

Addtionally, this project gave me a chance to recall a few treasured family traditions, and in doing so, share a little bit of myself with you.
