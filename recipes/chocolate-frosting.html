    <h2>Wasted Calories Well Worth It</h2>

    <p>Thanks to the awesome power of heavy cream and butter, this chocolate frosting recipe is positively <br>
        shameless in it's approach, because unless you're living your best dairy-free life, why not go <br>
        for broke on the toppings? After all, life is too short and dessert is too damn good.</p>

    <p>(Alternately, this recipe also holds up great with soy milk in place of the heavy cream)!</p>

      <li>1/3 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
