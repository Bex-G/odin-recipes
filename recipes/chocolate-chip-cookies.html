    <h2>A Tradition of Homebaked Goodness</h2>
      <p>My family has been baking these cookies since before I was <br>
        born--ever since it was published in a book by their favorite <br>
         bakery, an unassuming little place tucked between the Santa <br>
        Cruz Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

        <p>The recipe has changed somewhat over the years with my ever-<br>
          resourceful and [somewhat frighteningly] experimental mother <br>
          adding this or that, sometimes scribbling annotations with a<br>
          pencil, only to scrub the changes away a few weeks later.</p>

          <p>What remains today is the culmination of all her tricks;<br>
            a recipe transformed by a woman who never did things by the<br>
            book, and me, the kid she taught to follow directions to a "t."<br>
