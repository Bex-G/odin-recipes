    <h2>A Tradition of Homemade Goodness</h2>

      <p>My family has been baking these cookies since before I was born--ever since it was published <br>
        in a book by their favorite bakery, an unassuming little place tucked between the Santa Cruz <br>
         Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

        <p>The recipe has changed somewhat over the years with my ever-resourceful and [occasionally ridiculous] <br>
          mother adding this or that, sometimes scribbling annotations, only to scrub them away a few weeks later.</p>

          <p>What remains today is the culmination of all her tricks: a recipe transformed by a woman who <br>
            never did things by the book, and me, the kid she taught to follow directions to a "t."</p>

            <p>From my family to yours, I hope you enjoy!</p>
